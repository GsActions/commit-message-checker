# GS Commit Message Checker

![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/gsactions/commit-message-checker?style=flat-square)
![Test](https://github.com/gsactions/commit-message-checker/workflows/build-test/badge.svg)

A GitHub action that checks that commit messages match a regex pattern. The
action is able to act on pull request and push events and check the pull
request title and body, or the commit message of the commits of a push.

On pull requests the title and body are concatenated, delimited by two line
breaks.

Designed to be very flexible in usage, you can split checks into various
workflows, use action types on pull request to listen on, define branches
for pushes etc. etc.

## Configuration

See also [action definition](action.yml) and the following example workflow.

More information about `pattern` and `flags` can be found in the
[JavaScript reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp).

`flags` is optional and defaults to `gm`.

`excludeDescription`, `excludeTitle` and `checkAllCommitMessages` are optional.
Default behavior is to include the description and title and not check pull
request commit messages.

### Example Workflow

```yml
name: 'Commit Message Check'
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - edited
      - reopened
      - synchronize
  pull_request_target:
    types:
      - opened
      - edited
      - reopened
      - synchronize
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - 'releases/*'

jobs:
  check-commit-message:
    name: Check Commit Message
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check Commit Type
        uses: gsactions/commit-message-checker@v1
        with:
          pattern: '\[[^]]+\] .+$'
          flags: 'gm'
          error: 'Your first line has to contain a commit type like "[BUGFIX]".'
      - name: Check Line Length
        uses: gsactions/commit-message-checker@v1
        with:
          pattern: '^[^#].{74}'
          error: 'The maximum line length of 74 characters is exceeded.'
          excludeDescription: 'true' # optional: this excludes the description body of a pull request
          excludeTitle: 'true' # optional: this excludes the title of a pull request
          checkAllCommitMessages: 'true' # optional: this checks all commits associated with a pull request
          accessToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # github access token is only required if checkAllCommitMessages is true
      - name: Check for Resolves / Fixes
        uses: gsactions/commit-message-checker@v1
        with:
          pattern: '^.+(Resolves|Fixes): \#[0-9]+$'
          error: 'You need at least one "Resolves|Fixes: #<issue number>" line.'
```
